                    In the Fall of 2015, I attended Wyncode - a Ruby On Rails bootcamp in Miami, Florida - where I discovered my passion for coding.
                    After graduating from Wyncode, I decided to pursue my thirst for programming knowledge even further by attending We Can Code IT: a C# and .NET-focused web development bootcamp in Cleveland, Ohio.<br /><br />I am a person who takes great pride in the work I do, and I'm always looking to improve and grow as a developer.
